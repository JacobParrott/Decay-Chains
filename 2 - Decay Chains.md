# Decay Chains

## Background

So far, we have dealt with the case where one isomer decays to another and this resulting isomer is stable. However, sometimes the resulting isomer isomer can also be radioactive and so decay to another isomer and so on. The [Thorium decay series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decay_chain#Thorium_series) is an example of a deacy chain. A section of this includes
