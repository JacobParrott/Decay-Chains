# Decay-Chains

## Overview

This project will take you through the process of developing a model of the decay of radioactive isotopes. Such decays are found in several places including nuclear reactors, nuclear waste, and nuclear medicine. Being able to model which isotopes are present as a function of time and how much energy they give out is important for safely utilising these materials. In this project, you will be guided through the production of a Python code containing the time-dependent model of the abundance of these isotopes given an initial concentration. 

It is not intended the users of this resource will have any knowledge of the subject matter before commencing the project. This project assumes a basic knowledge of Git and GitHub and an intermediate level of Python knowledge.

## How To Use This Resource

This resource contains a number of markdown files designed to be tackled in order. These files contain a series of tasks designed to be tackled in order to iteratively increase the complexity of the code you are working on, along with the requisite scientific backround. Within many files there will be two streams of tasks e.g. "1A", "1B", etc. These are designed to be tackeld in parallel so, if you're completing these tasks as part of a group, you can split up the work more easily.

Each task will have an associated file in the ```tests``` directory containing tests for the functionality you should develop during the task. In order to interface your code with the tests, you should also edit the associated ```test_interfaces.py``` file.

You should now progress to The file ```0 - Getting Started```
